					<h1>ABOUT US</h1>

					<p>Our story begins with a man whose life was all about creativity. He was a musician, a composer, <br>
					a guitarist and a singer as well as a writer, director and actor in theatrical productions for his <br>
					church and community. For many years he composed a good deal of music including an oratorio, <br>
					a Christmas cantata, children’s musicals, multiple instrumental and choral works and <br>
					hundreds of songs. He wrote plays, lyrics, children’s stories, poems and even jokes. <br> 
					<h1>JOKES.</h1>  
					He loved jokes.  He made up his own and memorized the best jokes that he had heard. <br>
					He enjoyed imitating various accents and celebrity voices – both speaking and singing voices. <br>
					You might say that he used creativity to serve God and humanity.He not only enjoyed being creative<br>
					but he appreciated all of the arts and marveled at great creativity.  He loved going to popular <br>
					and classical concerts, plays and enjoyed  great performance groups from the Russian Ballet <br>
					to Cirque D’Soliel.  He loved it when creativity and excellence was on display.  He loved going<br>
					to museums and special exhibits, learning about history, culture and seeing the finest art offerings <br>
					from around the world.  He had not traveled much but he was fascinated by the many diverse cultures <br>
					in the world and their creativity and creative solutions to the challenges of life. Overall, he was <br>
					a happy person and it was one of his goals and passions to make other people happy.  He had a loving <br>
					family and loved being with them. I suppose that the only thing missing in his life is that he was<br>
					so busy that he did not have time to travel. However,  the few times he did, he loved it.  <br>
					But at this point in his life, there was simply no time for travel.

					<h1>ALL OF THAT WAS ABOUT TO CHANGE:</h1>

					One day this Minister of Music received a letter inviting him to go to China for a very small amount<br>
					of money on a FAM trip for choral directors, with a view to take his choral group to China for a choir <br>
					tour in the future.  This intrigued him and although his first thought was that he probably didn’t have<br>
					time to do this, his choir was very excited about the idea, so he went on the FAM trip in May, 1996.  <br>
					He  went only to Shanghai and Suzhou but was captivated by the trip. It was an amazing experience!  <br>
					SO they set up the choir tour for late December, 1996-early January, 1997 to Beijing, Nanjing <br>
					and Shanghai.  His brother, who was a high official in the <br>
					United Nations Development Projects (UNDP) was currently assigned to work in Mongolia helping <br>
					them to develop their economy in a post-Communist <br>
					society.  His brother wrote him, “when you have finished your Choir tour, why don’t you come up and <br>
					visit me in Mongolia?”   Which is exactly what he did.   

					<h1>THE CHOIR CHINA TOUR: </h1> 
					The choir tour went fantastically despite some obstacles which we will save for another story. <br>
					Suffice it to say that this man was hooked on travel. When the choir tour ended, he flew to Mongolia<br>
					in early January.  Now Mongolia is just south of Siberia.  So going to Mongolia in January brings <br>
					to mind the Indiana Jones movie where fur wrapped people were coming in out of the cold <br>
					and knocking down shots of vodka to keep from freezing to death.  When the man arrived,<br>
					he looked out of the window of the airplane seeing only varying degrees of white and <br>
					snow flurries hitting the window.  <br>
					His first thought was, “what on earth am I doing here?”  However, he soon met with <br>
					his brother and was introduced into a new and magical world!  <br>
					This was a land of nomads living in gers (or Russian built <br>
					apartments in UlaanBaatar), with an 80-foot tall statue of Buddha made out of bronze, silver, gold and <br>
					precious stones.  There were Tuvan Throat singers, contortionists, horse-headed fiddlers <br>
					and traditional dancers.  The many historic sites were fascinating to see and <br>
					the Khan’s Summer Palace had many unique features like a ger covered totally <br>
					in snow leopard pelts, an empresses dress covered in over 14,000 pearls set in Shuo<br>
					patterns, Mongolian totem statues, etc. etc.  Some of his brother’s government <br>
					official friends took the two brothers on a winter road trip (bundle up!) <br>
					to Karakhorum, the ancient capital of Chinggis (you say Genghis) Khan. <br>
					The drive on the semi-paved, semi-dirt, semi-non-existent road was quite interesting.<br>
					After various stops to get out and stretch (where he viewed the incredible expanse of the <br>
					Steppe with mountain ranges in the distance) and a little target practice on some nearby rocks <br>
					(anyone concerned about richochet?) they reached Karakhorum.  It was so cold there that the man <br>
					would inhale and his beard would be full of frost.  He would wipe it away as he exhaled, then we<br>
					would inhale again and repeat the process.   After an unsuccessful wolf hunt, ice fishing and <br>
					getting the various jeeps stuck in the snow drifts, pushing them out by hand and teaching <br>
					the Mongols “high fives” when they were successful, they all returned to the capital <br>
					of UlaanBaatar. <br>

					Our newly traveling friend had many adventures and fell in love with these types of experiences. <br>
					But when the Mongol leaders and businessmen heard that he had just brought 35 Americans to China <br>
					they asked him, “can you bring Americans to Mongolia?”  His brother informed him that if he wanted <br>
					to start a tour business that the various Mongolian people would be delighted to help him get started.<br>
					He thought about this and felt that as much as he loved what he was doing, he also loved travel  <br>
					so he decided to start a tour business.  On the way back to the USA through China he checked with <br>
					the Chinese company which provided his travel services and asked them if they would work <br>
					with him as a tour operator and they happily responded that indeed they would.  So, <br>
					when he returned to the USA he started to set up his company.<br>

					  

					<h1>THE NATURE OF MGTC:</h1>  
					The same spirit of love of people and great experiences that characterized our Minister so he <br>
					of Music’s work can be seen in MGTC.  We love people, culture history, music, theatre, <br>
					Wonders of the World as well as off-beat and unique experiences.  It is our goal to provide<br>
					our guests and friends incredible world experiences and memories. Our Destination Specialists<br>
					are not just sales people, they have traveled extensively and know the destinations which they<br>
					are working with you on. The destinations that we do not know as well, we will typically add<br>
					these to our travel schedule to fill the gap.  We love filling tours with excitement, <br>
					adventure, culture, humor, music and wonderful lifetime memories! </p>
